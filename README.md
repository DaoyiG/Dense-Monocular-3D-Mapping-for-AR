### Project Description:
This is the course project of **Perception and Learning in Robotics and Augmented Reality** in summer semester 2020 in computer vision group from TUM Chair for Computer Aided Medical Procedures & Augmented Reality.  

The pipeline of our project is from a sequence of monocular RGB images to a dense 3D reconstruction, and an automatic ( manual as well) AR pipeline to create a sequence of augmented images.
